<p class="" id="e3d533e6-5d13-4c9d-9ba9-4b9221e27d0a">A 48-year-old man comes to the
                                        office with his wife for follow-up of major depressive disorder.  The patient
                                        has been taking sertraline for 2 years, and due to a recurrence of depression,
                                        he started bupropion and weekly cognitive behavioral therapy 3 weeks ago.  Since
                                        then, his energy level has improved, and he is working on communicating more
                                        with his wife about his emotions.  The patient has no suicidal ideation and is
                                        hopeful that he will feel better with continued treatment.  A week later, his
                                        wife calls the office and states that her husband died by suicide a few days
                                        ago.  She is tearful on the phone and says, "I thought that he was doing
                                        better.  I don't understand how this happened."  Which of the
                                        following is the most appropriate response?</p>

                                                    unexpected loss of a loved one produces intense, acute grief.  When
                                                    the cause of death is suicide, the emotional pain may be further
                                                    complicated by a range of difficult emotions including guilt and
                                                    anger as well as difficulty comprehending what happened.  The need
                                                    to make sense of the suicide may be especially intense when the
                                                    family member perceives that the patient was doing better
                                                    beforehand, as in this case.</p>

                                                    comfortable doing.  It is preferable to allow the wife to express
